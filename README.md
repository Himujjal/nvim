# AI Features in Neovim

Neovim now includes AI-driven features to enhance coding:

- **code completion**: predicts code snippets and functions as you type.
- **syntax highlighting**: ai-enhanced, context-aware coloring.
- **code refactoring**: offers suggestions for improving structure and efficiency.
- **error detection**: provides real-time error detection and correction suggestions.
- **documentation generation**: automatically generates documentation comments.
- **smart search**: performs context-aware searches with improved relevance.

These features streamline development and boost productivity within Neovim.

For now, we aren't going for full context

Whisper and Supermaven are going to be wonders for Neovim to come in the future.

gpnvim is such a cool plugin

So gp.nvim is a great tool and that is what's going to augment our workflow and make sure that we are fast in track with AI.
with the power of nvim and gp.nvim, we can unlock the full potential of AI-assisted development.
